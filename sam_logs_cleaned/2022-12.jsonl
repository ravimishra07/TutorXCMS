First, create a `Worker` class to represent the background task. This class should extend `Worker` and override the `doWork()` method, where you will put the code to upload the file. You can use the `setProgress()` method to set the progress of the upload and the `getInputData()` method to retrieve the file to be uploaded from the `WorkRequest`:\n\n```\nclass FileUploadWorker(appContext: Context, workerParams: WorkerParameters) : Worker(appContext, workerParams) {\n    override fun doWork(): Result {\n        // Get the file to upload from the input data\n        val fileUri = inputData.getString(\"fileUri\")\n        val file = Uri.parse(fileUri).let { uri ->\n            contentResolver.openFileDescriptor(uri, \"r\")?.use {\n                FileInputStream(it.fileDescriptor).channel.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, it.channel.size())\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Upload the file\n        val response = uploadFileToServer(file)\n\n        // Return the result of the work\n        return if (response.isSuccessful) {\n            Result.success()\n        } else {\n            Result.failure()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Next, create a `WorkRequest` to schedule the background task. You can use a `OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder` to build a `OneTimeWorkRequest` or a `PeriodicWorkRequest.Builder` to build a `PeriodicWorkRequest`, depending on whether you want to run the task once or on a regular basis. In either case, you can use the `setInputData()` method to set the file to be uploaded as input data for the `Worker`:\n\n```\nval fileUri = // ...\nval fileUploadWork = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<FileUploadWorker>()\n    .setInputData(workDataOf(\"fileUri\" to fileUri.toString()))\n    .build()\n```\n\n3.

Here is an example of how you might create a started service in Android to play music in the background:\n\n1. First, create a class that extends `Service` and overrides the `onStartCommand()` method. This is where you will put the code to play the music:\n\n```\nclass MusicService : Service() {\n    private val player = MediaPlayer()\n\n    override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {\n        // Get the music file URI from the intent\n        val musicUri = intent?.getStringExtra(\"musicUri\")\n\n        // Start playing the music\n        player.reset()\n        player.setDataSource(this, Uri.parse(musicUri))\n        player.prepare()\n        player.start()\n\n        // Return the service sticky to keep it running until it is explicitly stopped\n        return START_STICKY\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Next, define the service in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This is necessary so that the system knows about the service and can start it when needed:\n\n```\n<service\n    android:name=\".MusicService\"\n    android:exported=\"false\"\n    android:process=\":music\">\n</service>\n```\n\n3. To start the service, you can use an `Intent` and call `startService()`:\n\n```\nval musicUri = // ...\nval startIntent = Intent(this, MusicService::class.java).apply {\n    putExtra(\"musicUri\", musicUri)\n}\nstartService(startIntent)\n```\n\nThis will start the service and run it in the background until it is stopped. To stop the service, you can call `stopService()`:\n\n```\nstopService(startIntent)\n```\n\nThis will stop the service and release any resources it is using.\n\nI hope this example helps to clarify how services work in Android.

It's similar to other layout managers in Android, but with ConstraintLayout, you can specify how views should be positioned relative to each other by creating constraints between them.\n\nIn a ConstraintLayout, you can specify two types of constraints: chains and biases.\n\nChains are groups of views that are connected by constraints and behave as a unit. You can create chains to make views distribute evenly, align in a row or column, or distribute space between them. There are three types of chains:\n\n1. Spread chain: distributes views evenly within the chain\n2. Spread inside chain: distributes views evenly within the chain, but with some space left at the beginning and end of the chain\n3. Packed chain: aligns views in a row or column, with no space between them\n\nBias is a property that allows you to specify how much a view should be biased towards one side or the other. For example, if you have a view that should be horizontally centered but slightly closer to the left side, you can set a horizontal bias of 0.8 (leaning towards the left). Bias can be set for both horizontal and vertical dimensions.\n\nHere's an example of a ConstraintLayout with a chain and bias:\n\n```\n<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n    <Button\n        android:id=\"@+id/button1\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintVertical_bias=\"0.3\"\n        android:text=\"Button 1\" />\n\n    <Button\n        android:id=\"@+id/button2\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf=\"@id/button1\"\n        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintVertical_bias=\"0.7\"\n        android:text=\"Button 2\" />\n\n    <Button\n        android:id=\"@+id/button3\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=\"parent\"\n        app:layout_constraintVertical_bias=\"0.5\"\n        android:text=\"Button 3\" />\n\n</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>\n```\n\nThis layout creates a chain of three buttons, with button1 and button3 connected to the parent layout and button2 connected to button1.

Uploading data to a server: If you have an app that needs to periodically upload data to a server (such as logs or analytics), you can use WorkManager to schedule the uploads to run in the background. This ensures that the uploads are done efficiently and reliably, even if the app is not running or the device is in doze mode.\n\n2. Syncing data with a server: If you have an app that needs to sync data with a server (such as a task manager or a note-taking app), you can use WorkManager to schedule the sync to run in the background. This ensures that the sync is done efficiently and reliably, even if the app is not running or the device is in doze mode.\n\n3. Performing background tasks: If you have an app that needs to perform a long-running task in the background (such as resizing an image or compressing a video), you can use WorkManager to schedule the task to run in the background. This ensures that the task is done efficiently and reliably, even if the app is not running or the device is in doze mode.\n\nOverall, WorkManager is a powerful and flexible tool that can be used in a variety of scenarios to manage background work in an efficient and reliable manner.

Reducing the number of calls to findViewById() can improve the performance of the application, because this method can be slow if it has to search through a large view hierarchy multiple times.\n\n2. Storing references to the views in a ViewHolder allows the views to be reused when the list scrolls, rather than creating new views for each item. This can reduce the memory footprint of the application and improve its overall performance.\n\n3.

If you are using a custom document class or template, it could be that the `itemize` and `enumerate` environments are not supported.

But as these two platforms are different, they use different tool and different set of frameworks. Some of these feature are unique to their platforms and are not available in the other.\n\nOne such feature is android’s TabLayout provided by Material Design Support library. It’s really easy to implement in android. Unfortunately, iOS does not have any native widget similar to it.\n\nIn this article I will walk you through the steps to build a functionality like TabLayout in iOS using UIKit.\n\nThe approach we will follow require use of UIPageViewController. We can also create this functionality using UIScrollView and UIView’s by calculating drag or gesture, or by using CollectionView.\n\nI find current approach better when each tab’s view is heavy and have inside it complex widgets like UICollectionView and UITableView.\n\nUse of UIPageViewController gives us full controller over the foregrounds tab and we can do everything on tab’s view as itself a UIViewController.\n\nLets have a look at our end product\n\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nCreate a single view project.\n2. Since we need to create equal sized tabs, we will add a horizontal StackView and 3. buttons inside. We will keep first tab(button) filled as first tab will open by default.\n\nNote: this demo is only for three static tabs. If tab are more than three, then use of UIScrollView or UICollectionView is recommended.\n\nHere is how it’ll look in storyboard.\n\n\n3. Add a UIView beneath the UIStackView and add constraints such it fills rest of the screen.\n4. We will make buttons to change colour when tapped. Create outlets and actions for all the all the buttons.\n\nI have created function updateButtons() to highlight the tapped button and deselect the others. We will call this function from the button actions with respective arguments. Below is the code implementation\n\n\n5. Add UIPageViewController in your storyboard. Add a respective swift class and connect them. We will add this as a subview in main view controller.\n\nMain function of UIPageViewController is to enable transition between our controller. It is somewhat similar to android’s ViewPager class.\n\n6. Add three controllers that we’ll associate with the tabs. You can adding anything in these controllers as per your needs. To keeps things we will just added different background colours on the main view of controller.\n\n\nDescription of transition between controllers\n7. Now we’ll add UIPageViewController as subview below the tabs in main view controller.\n\n\n8. Now we have added page controller inside MainController. We’ll now configure UIPageViewController.\n\nInitialise an array of view controllers. We don’t want all three controllers to be in memory . Hence, for loose coupling array of view controllers are set as lazy.\n\n\nWe want first tab to be selected and visible when app loads . Add the follow code block inside viewDidLoad() and don’t forget to implement UIPageViewControllerDelegate in main class.\n\n\nWe’ll now two important delegate functions viewControllerAfter and viewControllerBefore. These two page controller functions update the controller and index when user swipes in either direction. These added as extension for cleaner code.\n\n\n9. Build the app, you could see swiping changes the controller, indicated by the background colour.\n\nNow we have to connect tabs with the controllers. What we will do is to create functions to update tabs in PageController and access it on button actions in main controller through its object.\n\nI have compared current tab index with tab we intend to move and determined the direction of swipe animation.\n\n\nBuild again and check the app. Tab are working now. Great!. Now we are close to our final product.\n\nYou could see the tabs(buttons) don’t update automatically on swipe. We have to send an action from the page controller(tab controllers) to the page main controller.\n\nThere are multiple ways to do it. You can use delegate, accessing the parent class(main controller) and calling a function to update tabs or you can use NotificationCenter.\n\nIn this demo I have use NotificationCenter. We post a notification and it’s like a pulse that can be caught by any observer by the same name. I posted notification in UIPageViewControllerDelegate’s didFinishAnimating function. It sends current index by embedding it an Dictionary\n\n\nWe will now add observer in PageController’s viewDidLoad() function. We’ll also add a handler function that will do the task of updation tabs.\n\n\nAnd that’s it!!.\n\n\nWe did it!\nBuild and check the app. It should be working fine.\n\nYou can check this GitHub link. I’ve added all controllers in it, you just need to add those files in your project and set outlets, action and controllers in you storyboard.\n\n!!!

These tools allow you to define the dependencies between your modules in a declarative way, and they will automatically resolve and download the required dependencies at build time.\n\nTo use dependencies in a multi-module project, you will need to define the dependencies in the build file for each module that depends on another module. For example, in Gradle, you can use the `dependencies` block to define the dependencies for a module:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation project(\":moduleA\")\n    implementation project(\":moduleB\")\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the module depends on `moduleA` and `moduleB`. The `implementation` configuration specifies that the dependency is required at runtime.\n\nTo handle abstraction in a multi-module project, you can use interfaces and abstract classes to define a contract that can be implemented or extended by different modules. This allows you to decouple the implementation details of a module from the rest of the system, and it makes it easier to test and maintain your code.\n\nHere's an example of how to use interfaces and abstract classes to handle abstraction in a multi-module project:\n\n```\n// Module A\ninterface MyInterface {\n    fun doSomething(): Int\n}\n\n// Module B\nclass MyImplementation: MyInterface {\n    override fun doSomething(): Int {\n        // Implementation details\n    }\n}\n\n// Module C\nclass MyClient {\n    private val myInterface: MyInterface\n\n    constructor(myInterface: MyInterface) {\n        this.myInterface = myInterface\n    }\n\n    fun callDoSomething() {\n        val result = myInterface.doSomething()\n        // Use the result\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `Module A` defines an interface `MyInterface` that specifies the contract for a certain behavior. `Module B` implements this interface with the `MyImplementation` class. `Module C` depends on `MyInterface`, but it does not know or care about the implementation details. It simply calls the `doSomething()` method on the interface, and it uses the result.

Both patterns are designed to improve the testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns of an application.\n\nMVVM and MVP are similar in many ways, but they have some important differences that may make one pattern more suitable than the other in a particular situation. Here are some of the main differences between MVVM and MVP:\n\n- Data binding: MVVM uses data binding to automatically update the UI when the underlying data changes. This can make it easier to develop and maintain the UI, because you don't have to write code to manually update the UI whenever the data changes. MVP, on the other hand, does not use data binding, so you have to manually update the UI when the data changes.\n\n- Architecture: MVVM uses a three-layer architecture, with the ViewModel layer acting as the mediator between the View and the Model. The ViewModel exposes data and commands to the View, and it handles the UI logic and the communication with the Model. MVP, on the other hand, uses a two-layer architecture, with the Presenter layer acting as the mediator between the View and the Model. The Presenter handles the UI logic and the communication with the Model, and it exposes data and commands to the View through a View interface.\n\n- Lifecycle management: MVVM is designed to work with Android's lifecycle components, such as Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels. It allows you to easily manage the lifecycle of your ViewModels and preserve their state across configuration changes. MVP, on the other hand, does not have built-in support for Android's lifecycle components, so you have to manually manage the lifecycle of your Presenter and ensure that it is correctly attached and detached from the View.\n\nIn general, MVVM is a more modern and flexible pattern that is better suited to modern Android development. It uses data binding to automatically update the UI, it has a three-layer architecture that is more modular and reusable, and it has built-in support for Android's lifecycle components. MVP, on the other hand, is a more traditional pattern that requires more manual coding and is less flexible. It does not use data binding, it has a two-layer architecture that is less modular, and it does not have built-in support for Android's lifecycle components.\n\nUltimately, the choice between MVVM and MVP depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project. Both patterns have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you should choose the one that best fits your project's requirements.", "tags": [], "mood": "joy", "emotion": "positive", "energyTier": "neutral", "stateTag": "active", "isDraft": false, "source": "chatgpt_export", "rating": null, "energyScore": 0.558, "keywords": ["mvvm mvp", "differences mvvm", "mvp design"]}

This can make your tests more reliable and faster, because they do not depend on the state or behavior of external components.\n\n- Improved maintainability: Dependency injection makes it easier to maintain and evolve a class over time, because you can change its dependencies without modifying the class itself. This can make your code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n- Improved modularity: Dependency injection allows you to define the dependencies of a class in a declarative way, which can improve the modularity and reuse of your code. It also allows you to easily swap out one implementation for another, which can make your code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.\n\n- Improved separation of concerns: Dependency injection allows you to separate the business logic of a class from its dependencies, which can improve the separation of concerns and the readability of your code. It also allows you to easily reuse the business logic of a class in different contexts, by injecting different dependencies.\n\nOverall, dependency injection can improve the testability, maintainability, modularity, and separation of concerns of your code, and it can make it easier to develop and maintain large, complex systems.

Define the dependencies of your classes: The first step is to identify the dependencies of your classes and define them in a way that allows you to inject them. This can be done using interfaces or abstract classes, or using concrete classes with public constructors or setter methods.\n\n2. Create a dependency graph: The next step is to create a dependency graph that defines the relationships between the different dependencies of your classes. This can be done using a dependency injection framework, such as Dagger, or manually using a configuration file or code.\n\n3. Implement the dependency injection mechanism: The third step is to implement the mechanism that injects the dependencies into your classes. This can be done using reflection, code generation, or other techniques. The injection mechanism should be able to instantiate the dependencies, resolve any circular dependencies, and inject the dependencies into the required classes.\n\n4. Provide a way to configure the dependencies: The fourth step is to provide a way to configure the dependencies of your classes. This can be done using a configuration file, code, or a combination of both. The configuration should allow you to specify the dependencies of each class, as well as any customizations or overrides that are needed.\n\n5. Test and debug the dependency injection library: The final step is to test and debug your dependency injection library to ensure that it is working correctly and that it meets the requirements of your project. This may involve writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests to validate the different scenarios and edge cases that your library needs to support.\n\nOverall, creating your own dependency injection library requires a good understanding of the dependencies of your classes, as well as the techniques and tools that are available to implement dependency injection.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP): The Open-Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new behavior to a class without changing its existing code, by extending the class or implementing new interfaces.\n\n3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This means that if a class is a subtype of another class, it should be able to be used in any context where the base class is used, without breaking the code.\n\n4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that you should divide large interfaces into smaller, more focused interfaces that are easier to implement and maintain.\n\n5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This means that you should use abstractions, such as interfaces or abstract classes, to decouple your code from its dependencies, and you should depend on those abstractions rather than on concrete implementations.\n\nThe SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that can help you design more maintainable, scalable, and testable object-oriented software.

The pending intent can then be used to start an activity, send a broadcast, or start a service at a later time, by calling the `send` or `sendBroadcast` method on the `PendingIntent` object.\n\nPending intents are often used when an app needs to perform an action in the future, such as scheduling a notification or setting an alarm.

Sticky intents are used to communicate information that is available immediately, but that may also be needed later.
