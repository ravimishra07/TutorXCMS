This is when the activity is visible and interacts with the user.\n\nAt this point, Activity B is in the foreground, and Activity A may be partially or fully obscured depending on how Activity B is presented.\n\n3. **Back Navigation or Finishing Activity B**:\n   - If the user navigates back to Activity A or if Activity B finishes:\n     - `onPause()`: Activity B goes into the paused state.\n     - `onStop()`: Activity B goes into the stopped state.\n     - `onDestroy()`: Activity B is destroyed if it's finished.\n\n4. **Activity A Resuming from Paused or Stopped State**:\n   - If Activity A was partially or fully obscured by Activity B and comes back into focus:\n     - `onRestart()`: Activity A restarts if it was stopped.\n     - `onStart()`: Activity A starts if it was stopped.\n     - `onResume()`: Activity A resumes from the paused state.\n\nThis sequence may slightly vary depending on the flags and launch modes set for the activities and the specific actions performed within each activity's lifecycle methods.

Sometimes, intermittent connectivity issues can cause problems with downloading files.\n\n5. **Retry**: Sometimes, the issue might be temporary. You can try running the installation command again after a short while to see if it works.\n\n6. **SDKMAN Update**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of SDKMAN.
