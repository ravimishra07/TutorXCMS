When this flag is set, the system will create a new task for the target activity and place it on the top of the task stack. \n\nA task is a collection of activities that the user has worked with and can navigate between. Each task has its own back stack of activities.

This can be useful when launching activities from a background service, as it ensures that the new activity will be launched in a separate task and will not interfere with the user's current task.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where you have a background service that needs to launch an activity to display a notification to the user.

If an app has a memory leak, it can eventually cause the app to crash or the device to become slow or unresponsive.\n\nTo prevent memory leaks, it is important to properly manage the memory used by an app. This includes releasing references to objects that are no longer needed, avoiding circular references, and using the `WeakReference` class to hold onto objects that are needed only temporarily.\n\nThe Dalvik VM and the Android operating system (OS) perform garbage collection in the background to reclaim memory that is no longer being used by an app. However, the garbage collector can only reclaim memory that is no longer reachable by the app. If an app has a memory leak and is holding onto references to objects that it no longer needs, the garbage collector will not be able to reclaim that memory.\n\nTo help identify and fix memory leaks, Android provides tools such as the Android Profiler in Android Studio and the `mat` (Memory Analyzer Tool) command-line tool.

For example:\n\n```\nObject obj1 = new Object();\nObject obj2 = new Object();\nObject obj3 = obj1;\n\nSystem.out.println(obj1 == obj2); // prints \"false\"\nSystem.out.println(obj1 == obj3); // prints \"true\"\n```\n\nIn this case, the `==` operator returns `false` when called on `obj1` and `obj2` because these variables refer to two distinct objects. However, the `==` operator returns `true` when called on `obj1` and `obj3` because these variables both refer to the same object.\n\nThe `equals()` method, on the other hand, is used to compare the actual objects themselves, rather than the references. The `equals()` method is defined in the `Object` class, which is the parent class of all Java classes. By default, the `equals()` method simply compares the references of two objects to see if they are the same. However, you can override the `equals()` method in a subclass to provide your own implementation for determining whether two objects are equal.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nObject obj1 = new Object();\nObject obj2 = new Object();\nObject obj3 = obj1;\n\nSystem.out.println(obj1.equals(obj2)); // prints \"false\"\nSystem.out.println(obj1.equals(obj3)); // prints \"true\"\n```\n\nIn this case, the `equals()` method returns `false` when called on `obj1` and `obj2` because these variables refer to two distinct objects, even though the `==` operator would return `false` in this case. However, the `equals()` method returns `true` when called on `obj1` and `obj3` because these variables both refer to the same object.", "tags": [], "mood": "joy", "emotion": "neutral", "energyTier": "neutral", "stateTag": "active", "isDraft": false, "source": "chatgpt_export", "rating": null, "energyScore": 0.732, "keywords": ["java operator", "equals method", "object equals"]}

Here are the answers to the questions you listed:\n\n- What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?\n  - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a base class for one or more derived classes. An abstract class can contain both abstract methods (methods without an implementation) and concrete methods (methods with an implementation). An interface is a reference type that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. An interface specifies the behavior that a class must implement, but it does not provide any implementation for those methods.\n- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using abstract classes in Java?\n  - Some advantages of using abstract classes in Java include:\n    - Abstract classes provide a way to define common behavior that can be shared by multiple derived classes.\n    - Abstract classes allow for the creation of a common API that can be used to interact with a variety of different classes that all conform to the same abstract class.\n    - Abstract classes can provide a default implementation for some methods, while requiring derived classes to implement others.\n  - Some disadvantages of using abstract classes in Java include:\n    - Abstract classes can only be used as a base class, and they cannot be used to create objects directly.\n    - Abstract classes can be more difficult to understand and use than interfaces, as they can contain both abstract and concrete methods.\n    - Abstract classes can be less flexible than interfaces, as a class can only extend one abstract class, while it can implement multiple interfaces.\n- Can an abstract class have a constructor in Java?\n  - Yes, an abstract class in Java can have a constructor. A constructor is a special method that is used to create and initialize an object of a class. An abstract class can have one or more constructors, and these constructors can be used by derived classes to initialize their objects.\n- Can an abstract class have a main method in Java?\n  - Yes, an abstract class in Java can have a `main` method. The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program, and it is a static method that is called by the Java runtime to start the program. An abstract class can have a `main` method just like any", "tags": [], "mood": "joy", "emotion": "neutral", "energyTier": "neutral", "stateTag": "active", "isDraft": false, "source": "chatgpt_export", "rating": null, "energyScore": 0.73, "keywords": ["java abstract", "classes abstract", "java advantages"]}

Make the constructor of the class private, to prevent other objects from directly creating an instance of the class.\n2. Create a static field to hold the single instance of the class.\n3. Create a static method that returns the single instance of the class.

Here you are given the assignment to complete in 2-4 days’ time. This round is followed by android based round. You generally, also, have a round dedicated to your assignment. In my case at loco, I was asked to add features to my assignment during that round - It was to optimise searching(minimum api calls and best user exp.).\n\nHere are all rounds I had in Loco:\n1. Phone screening: - basic android questions, about my experience and other stuff.\n2. Assignment round-1: OMDB api based task\n3. Android round-2: Android fundamentals, about view model, lifecycle, coroutine, hilt, room and paging3 . One question was to explain all ways to share data b/w fragments of activity and which one is best.\n4. Managerial round - More like a behavioural round, no tech was asked\n5.
